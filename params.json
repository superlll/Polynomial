  "body": "### The project about Polynomial\r\nRequirement:Blue-teams will construct a polynomial addition program. The executable will consume two filenames from the command line and will print to stdout the sum of the two polynomials found in those files. These polynomials will be stored in the following format: 5 9 8 7 6 5 represents 9*x^4 + 8*x^3 + 7*x^2 + 6*x^1 + 5. More formally there will be a single line which begins with an integer that represents the length of the polynomial (the degree plus 1) followed by white-space then white-space separated coefficients in descending order. The program expects the highest-degree term to be non-zero. Example: 3 1 0 2 plus 5 1 0 0 1 2 should display to screen 5 1 0 1 1 4.<br>\r\nIf you do not know how to use it, you can see the 'README' which includes how to use it and introduction about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
